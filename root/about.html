<figcaption class="founders-text-3">
  It started first with James and Alexandra coming up with ideas
  for a start up company revolving around frugal innovation. Once
  they were satisified with the idea they named the company Inova.
  But the name was not official yet it was just in their thoughts,
  so they decided to invite their best friends who were also good
  at innovation, Lara, Alexandra and John, to come work with them.
  The friends accepted the offer and through several brainstormings and
  idea-mashups they decided on Inova as their start up company.
  And thats how Inova was created.

    <h2>Why frugal innovation is the way to go</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      We believe in frugal innovation because when the cost and
      complexity of a good gets reduced it will in turn make
      an otherwise durable good, only contain essential features.
      This means that selling such goods to developing countries
      could help the people living there afford luxuries such as
      cars and phones. What does Inova believe in more than to give
      back to the world? Even we do not know.
