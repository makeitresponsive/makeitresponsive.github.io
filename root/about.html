Johnson, James Smith, Christine Jackson, Alexandra Suarez and John
Mutumbo.
</em></figcaption>
<figcaption class="founders-text-3">
  It started first with James and Alexandra coming up with ideas
  for a start up company revolving around frugal innovation. Once
  they were satisified with the idea they named the company Inova.
  But the name was not official yet it was just in their thoughts,
  so they decided to invite their best friends who were also good
  at innovation, Lara, Alexandra and John, to come work with them.
  Lara and Alexandra were proficient in innovation methods and John
  was excellent at creativity techniques. Adding to James' skill of
  quick learning and Alexandra's applying of skills to practice,
  the group had a huge potential with their combined knowledge and
  attributes and they felt like there was nothing that could hold
  them back. The invited friends accepted the offer and through
  several brainstormings and idea-mashups they decided on Inova as
  their start up company. And thats how Inova was created.
